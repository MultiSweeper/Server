At the start of the game, the [start:] sequence is started, followed by [begin game:].
Then, at the start of a new turn, everybody receives a [turn id update:], and the player to play gets a [your turn:] request.
After that, a [board update:] sequence is sent to everybody, after which a new turn starts.

If, at some point, someone clicks a mine, everybody receives a [board update:] with 10's at the right places and the right [end condition:]. If a player loses, he gets promoted to spectator status and gets all applicable [begin game:]'s, [turn id update:]'s and [board update:]'s, and a [sudden exit:] when the entire game finishes. Then, for all remaining players, a new [begin game:] announces the beginning of the next round; unless the last round was already with two players, in which case the winner gets a "2" in the [end condition:], the other player a "1" in the [end condition:] and the spectators a [sudden exit:], and all connections are closed.

If, at some point, a protocol is violated, or the game otherwise has to suddenly terminate, a [sudden exit:] is sent to everybody and all connections are closed.
